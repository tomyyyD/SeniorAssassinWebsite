                <h2>When can I get someone out at a sporting event?</h2>
                <p>
                    A player is eligible to be eliminated before the scheduled time of the event. 
                    This means when they are walking to the track, field, or bus. However, once they 
                    have arrived at the location of the event and have begun participating in said 
                    event they are ineligible to be attacked. If they leave the event any activity 
                    related to said event such as a track runner warming up or grabbing the ice and 
                    medical kit, they are still considered to be participating in the event and can 
                    not be eliminated. This immunity ends when they are dismissed by their coaches 
                    and have exited either the playing field or bus.

                <h2>When can I get someone out in their cars?</h2>
                <p>
                    A player is not allowed to eliminate another player if the attacker is in a 
                    moving automobile. If the victim is in  a turned on automobile or an automobile 
                    that is moving then they can not be eliminated. However, if the car is turned 
                    off and parked, then they are open to elimination. Long story short, we do not 
                    want people screwing up other peoples cars or getting hurt.

                <h2>What Counts as Floaties/How to wear them?</h2>
                <p>
                    If wearing regular floaties, they must be visible, fully inflated, and secure on one's 
                    arm/elbow. If wearing a tube, then it must be around the waist. Any floaties that are 
                    not the standard commercially bought variety, must be validated by game makers and 
                    can not protect someone until that point.
